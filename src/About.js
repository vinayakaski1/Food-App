          We cannot deny the importance of food in our lives. As it is the basic
          need to survive. Yet some people waste not thinking that there are
          still some people that do not get any of it. We should always be
          careful while taking a meal on our plates. In other words, we should
          take only that much that our stomach can allow. Or else there will be
          wasting of food. In India there are many people living in slums, they
          do not have proper shelter. Moreover, they are not able to have even a
          one-time meal. They starve for days and are always in a state of
          sickness. Many children are there on roads who are laboring to get a
          daily meal. After seeing conditions like these people should not dare
          to waste food. Moreover, we should always provide food to the needy
          ones as much as we can.
